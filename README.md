## Shiny app for Developing Data Products Project

### Assignment

Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The
documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started
using your application.

1. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
2. Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box
3. Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

The application must include the following:

1. Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
2. Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
3. Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
4. You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
5. The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.

The Shiny application in question is entirely up to you. However, if you're
having trouble coming up with ideas, you could start from the simple
prediction algorithm done in class and build a new algorithm on one of the R
datasets packages. Please make the package simple for the end user, so that
they don't need a lot of your prerequisite knowledge to evaluate your
application. You should emphasize a simple project given the short time frame.
